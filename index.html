            <p>My name is Jared Gerards, I'm currently studying software development at SintLucas Eindhoven</p>
            <p>I juggle hobbies, but as of writing this I'm mainly into beatboxing, drawing (unprofessionaly), and I
                like to make music, however basic it might be :)</p>
            <p>In this website you'll be able to take a little peek into my mind and my abilities and see for yourself
                if I'm a good fit for your team, or you can
                just look around for fun.</p>
            <p>But don't forget to have a good time!</p>

                    Dreamcatcher is a game I made with an idea that just spawned in my head, namely the 360 FOV. It is
                    not finished yet, however I do plan on finishing it eventually<br>

                    As you can see the visuals are very trippy and do take a bit to get used to, however once you get
                    used to them, you <i>can</i> actually use it practically.

                <div>
                    This is the pause screen, another random idea that worked really well in game. I call it an
                    immersive experience, others call it the most intrusive pause screen they've ever seen, to each
                    their own I guess. <br> <br>

                <div style="background-color: #a0a0a0;">
                    This game taught me most of what I know about unity 3D now, including a bit about ShaderGraph,
                    ProBuilder, and World Space UI, among others. It has also taught me some important lessons in how to
                    come up with ideas for projects and how to actually turn them into a game instead of just a
                    tech-demo. This is something I immediately already applied to my next project, Qorst.

                <img src="media/Goldfish/gameplay.gif" alt="top down pixel art shooter gameplay">
                <div>
                    This is a hotline miami inspired game where a Goldfish has to kill everyone from "Goldfish Killing
                    Corp.". However, the fish obviously can't hold any guns, much less fire them, so the fish instead
                    switches from person to person in order to accomplish its task. <br><br>
                    This game was made for a game jam we had at school, which lasted around about 48 hours total. <br>
                    I mainly did all the asset art whilst my friend Kick did the level art and music and Faelin did most
                    of the coding. <br>

                <div>
                    Here you can see some of the assets I made for the game. I bought Aseprite just for this project
                    however I continue to use it as it is just that good.

                <div style="background-color: #a0a0a0;">
                    I love this project because it's the first project I've actually managed to finish with my friends,
                    and I also developed my art skills but above all else my ability to work on a game with a team.
                    It's also the first game jam I ever took part of, and it was fun to see how far we could get in a
                    short amount of time. We even continued progress on this game after the jam to fix some bugs and add
                    some features, and the game is out on <a href="https://de-heren-games.itch.io/goldfish-dreams"

                <div>
                    Pheatthph is a game some friends and I cooked up during one of our classic brainstorming
                    sessions.<br><br>
                    Pheatthph was made in UNITY and the project is currently still ongoing, with no planned end
                    date.

                <img src="media/fet/levelLoading.gif" alt="fleshy level loading system">
                <div>
                    The main idea behind the game is that you travel through different dimensions by going into this
                    creature called
                    pheatthph, a massive fetus in the sky. <br><br>
                    As you might be able to tell the concept is really weird, but it's surprisingly fun and
                    gives a good aesthetic. The main aesthetic is also that we went for PS1 style graphics as you might
                    be able to see in the footage above

                    This game was my first time using GitHub with others. We first wanted to use PlasticSCM but that was
                    too difficult to set up properly and I think we also had to pay, so instead we decided to learn and
                    use GitHub, which has become one of the handiest things I ever learnt programming wise.
                    What you see pictured above is also my first time using ProBuilder in Unity, which has also come in
                    very handy. <br>
                    <br>
                    All in all this game has just been very helpful in learning even if it's not much of a game right
                    now.

                    This is a very important project to me because it's what eventually got me signed in to my dream
                    college, Sint Lucas. <br><br>
                    I made this the night before I had the interview, so it was pretty rushed, however in a working
                    state. <br><br>
                    Afterwards I worked on it a little further before moving on to bigger projects at Sint Lucas!

                    From this project I didn't so much learn, as applied my previously built skills. However I did learn
                    a lot about (Java)Processing which remains one of my favourite ways to code, as it's very practical
                    programming but with great capacity for visual elements and a strong and expansive library.

            <p>Hello world!</p>
            <p>
                My name is Jared Gerards, I’m Dutch, I’m studying software development at SintLucas Eindhoven,
                and I love creativity (Artistic things like music, drawing, puzzling, etc.). As you can tell
                by the layout of the website I love old electronic stuff (even though these still look like
                this nowadays) and I love how many things people could do way back when even with so many
                limitations. I personally am not on the level of programming a BIOS yet but I’m willing to learn!
                (haha). But in all seriousness, in this portfolio page I’d like to show you a little piece of me
                on my journey through life, and the little projects I can take pride in.
                <br><br>
                For my actual programming skills I'd say I'm pretty decent. Being among the top in the class when it
                comes to coding skill and also enjoying delving into multiple languages. <br>
                I can competently code in C#, and Java, as well as JavaScript and Python, and I'm able to pick up a
                language relatively quickly. I also wish to learn more about php and how servers operate, so I can start
                working in that sector. And maybe someday branch off more into the world of machine languages. <br>
