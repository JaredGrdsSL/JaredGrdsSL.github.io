            <p>My name is Jared Gerards, I'm currently studying software development at <br>SintLucas Eindhoven</p>
            <p>I juggle hobbies, but as of writing this I'm mainly into beatboxing, drawing (unprofessionaly), and I
                like to make music, however basic it might be :)</p>
            <p>In this website you'll be able to take a little peek into my mind and my abilities and see for yourself
                if I'm a good fit for your team, or you can
                just look around for fun.</p>
            <p>But don't forget to have a good time!</p>

                <img src="media/fet/movement.gif" alt="gif of fleshy gameplay">
                <div>
                    Pheatthph is a game some friends and I cooked up during one of our classic brainstorming
                    sessions.<br><br>
                    Pheatthph was made in UNITY and the project is currently still ongoing, with no planned end
                    date.<br>
                    The main idea behind the game is that you travel through different dimentions by going into this
                    creature called
                    pheatthph, a massive fetus in the sky. <br><br>
                    As you might be able to tell the concept is really weird but it's surprisingly fun and
                    gives a good aesthetic. The main aesthetic is also that we went for PS1 style graphics as you might
                    be able to see in the footage above
                </div>

                <img src="media/Goldfish/gameplay.gif" alt="top down pixel art shooter gameplay">
                <div>
                    This is a hotline miami inspired game where a Goldfish has to kill everyone from "Goldfish Killing
                    Corp.". However, the fish obviously can't hold any guns, much less fire them, so the fish instead
                    switches from person to person in order to accomplish its task. <br><br>
                    This game was made for a game jam we had at school, which lasted around about 48 hours total. <br>
                    I mainly did all the asset art whilst my friend Kick did the level art and music and Faelin did most
                    of the coding. <br><br>
                    I love this project because it's the first project I've actually managed to finish with my friends,
                    and I also developed my art skills but above all else my ability to work on a game with a team.

                    This is a very important project to me because it's what eventually got me signed in to my dream
                    college, Sint Lucas. <br><br>
                    I made this the night before I had the interview, so it was pretty rushed, however in a working
                    state. <br><br>
                    Afterwards I worked on it a little further before moving on to bigger projects at Sint Lucas!

                    <br>(hence the name). <br>This actually became that server's banner which is why I included it here.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
            <p>
                My name is Jared Gerards, I’m Dutch, I’m studying software development at SintLucas Eindhoven,
                and I love creativity (Artistic things like music, drawing, puzzling, etc.). As you can tell
                by the layout of the website I love old electronic stuff (even though these still look like
                this nowadays) and I love how many things people could do way back when even with so many
                limitations. I personally am not on the level of programming a BIOS yet but I’m willing to learn!
                (haha). But in all seriousness, in this portfolio page I’d like to show you a little piece of me
                on my journey through life, and the little projects I can take pride in.
                <br><br>
                For my actual programming skills I'd say I'm pretty decent. Being among the top in the class when it
                comes to coding skill and also enjoying delving into multiple languages. <br>
                I can competently code in C#, and C++, as well as JavaScript and Python, and I'm able to pick up a
                language relatively quickly. I also wish to learn more about php and how servers operate so I can start
                working in that sector. <br>
